          If you're an immediate relative (you're all family) and over the age of 30, you'll be staying in cozy cabins onsite at Kennolyn. These are spread out across the property and are perfect for relaxing while still being close to all the action. Very nice! ($150 per night, per person, all meals included).

          If you're under 30—or just want to stay right in the heart of camp—you'll be staying in private bunkhouses with shared bathrooms. Think classic summer camp vibes with your own bunk and plenty of space to hang out. I call bottom bunk! ($100 per night, per person, all meals included)
